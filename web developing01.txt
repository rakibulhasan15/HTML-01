      <p style="font-size:35px; color:blue;">Even though Israel is a small <br>
        country it is always in the news.<br>
        The news continues to report on Jews moving to Israel,</p><br> 
        <hr>
      <p>on the technology <b>invented</b> there, but also on conflict, wars and tensions with <u>surrounding</u> people. Why? A look at Israelâ€™s history in the book of <i>Genesis</i> in the Bible LOG <sub>10</sub> X <sup>3</sup> reveals that <mark>4000 </mark>years ago a man, who is now very well known, went on a <strike>camping</strike> trip in that part of the <del>world.</del>  The Bible &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his story affects our &lt; body &gt;  future.</p>
             <pre>        &copy; This ancient man is Abraham 
                    We can take his story seriously because the 
            places and cities he visited 
                    are mentioned in other old writings</pre>
